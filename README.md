# Stock Prediction

RSI = 100 â€“ [100 / ( 1 + (Average of Upward Price Change / Average of Downward Price Change ) ) ]

Most SMA(simple moving average) is for swinging or long term holding positions.
since this is only 3 months data, we can see SMA 100
If the market price is above SMA 50, it is uptrend, below is downtrend

When we do yearly data set analyze, day chart on 20 years
"Essentially, a bullish crossover (the 50-day MA moving above the 100-day MA) is called a golden cross 
and it signals that a new bullish trend is starting."
